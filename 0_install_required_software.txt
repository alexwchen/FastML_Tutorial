Installation Packages Needed
----------------------------
boost
1) Download the source at http://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost/1.53.0/
( I tried but this doesn't work, therefore I download 1.53 from here. )

2) Execute the shell script with "./bootstrap.sh" 
( run this if permission problem with shell script: chmod u+rwx filename)
( this step fails on me when I use 1.50 (.../build.sh command not found. Therefore I switch to 1.53 and it worked)
( might have to do "sudo su" to run shell script )

3) Next run the command "bjam install"
b2 install
( might need to download and compile bjam if you don't have it already )
(http://www.boost.org/users/download/boost_jam_3_1_18.html)

4) Tricky Step
what's important after these steps is really 
./boost/include (path to include)
./libs ( path to lib )
( this is kind of important, but they are probably not put in the right place )
( see next section for continuation )

vowpal_wabbit

1) This is the official documentation
https://github.com/JohnLangford/vowpal_wabbit/wiki/Tutorial

2) Download vowpal wabbit from 
git clone git://github.com/JohnLangford/vowpal_wabbit.git

3) Key Step (modify make file)

3-1)change all the BOOST_INCLUDE to something like this
/Users/alexwchen/Downloads/boost_1_53_0/boost/include
3-2)change BOOST_LIBRARY to something like this
/Users/alexwchen/Downloads/boost_1_53_0/libs 
3-3)if you run it like this, you will get errer complaining cant find -lboost_program_options-mt
Solution:
(seperate -l and boost_program_options-mt)
(change all boost_program_options-mt to boost_program_options)

same concepts goes to boost_serialization-mt, just get rid of -mt

**This same modification might also have to do it in other Makefile that is called by the main guy (just read the error and find them, easy)**

(WHY?)
You can go into ./libs
you will see program_options folder but not program_options-mt
you will see serialization folder but not serialization-mt


4)  Compile and cross your fingers
cd vowpal_wabbit; make

5) If it works thank god, now hope this work too
make test
( it did for me )
